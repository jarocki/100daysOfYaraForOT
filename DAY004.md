# #100daysofyara for #OT -- Day004

The first few Yara [rules in this repo](100daysOfYaraForOT) introduced the IEC 61131-3 
standard for programming operational technology equipment (ICS, SCADA, cyber physical, 
etc.).

For the next several rules, we are going to look at Structured Text variants that are 
specific to particular manufacturers.  There are dozens of suppliers, but here
are some that are very popular:

- DAY 004: CoDeSys, now known as CODESYS
  In 1994, the German company 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH
  released version 1.0 of CODESYS Development System, which is free to use.
  Applications built with CODESYS can run on devices that run the CODESYS
  Runtime Platform, including the SoftPLC virtual PLC system.  CODESYS has
  a few structured text extensions:
  - S= and R= the set and reset assignments
  - .FB_init and .FB_reinit methods
  - The special pointers SUPER^ and THIS^
 
- DAY 005: Emerson PAC Machine Edition (Formerly GE Proficy)
  GE Proficy was very popular in the US market, and now another US based
  company, Emerson Electric, has taken ownership of this platform and
  rebranded it as Emerson PAC Machine Edition.  An interesting quirk of
  structured text exported from Machine Edition is that it uses an
  apostrophe to denote inline comments, for example:
  - ```'-------------------
    '    Created:
   ```

- Mitsubishi Electric produces the MELSEC line of controllers.
